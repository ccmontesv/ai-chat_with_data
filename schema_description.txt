## Primary Key Consideration:

There is no explicit unique identifier in this table. However, the combination of the following fields could serve as a **composite primary key**:
- Region
- Year
- Product
- Sales_Rep

This assumes that each sales rep only handles one product in a region per year.

## Relationships:
This table appears to be self-contained with no foreign keys. It could be linked to:
- A `products` table (with descriptions, categories, prices)
- A `regions` table (with geo-coordinates or countries)
- A `sales_reps` table (with contact details or teams)

---

## Example queries the LLM could generate from this schema:

- Total sales per region per year
- Top 3 sales reps by revenue in 2023
- Average units sold for product 'Alpha' in the North region
- Compare total sales between 2022 and 2023
